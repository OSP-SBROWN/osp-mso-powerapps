# MSO Power App - Features and Processes Documentation

## Overview
The MSO (Macro Space Optimisation) Power App centralises merchandising and reporting workflows used to balance category space across retail stores and clusters. The application now runs against the `MSO-DB-v6` SQL Server database, allowing the Power App to orchestrate report creation, bay-rule governance, user administration, and performance analysis through curated stored procedures.

**Current Status:** SQL-integrated baseline available
**Last Updated:** October 14, 2025
**Version:** 1.1.0

## Application Architecture

### App Type
- **Platform:** Microsoft Power Apps
- **App Type:** Canvas app packaged inside an MSO solution
- **Target Devices:** Desktop (primary), tablet (responsive layout under validation)

### Technical Stack
- **Frontend:** Power Apps Canvas experience with reusable components and gallery-driven navigation
- **Backend:** SQL Server database `MSO-DB-v6`
- **Authentication:** Azure Active Directory (Office 365 logins) mapped to the `Users` table
- **Hosting:** Microsoft Power Platform (online)

### Data Access Layer
- Power Apps connects to SQL via the SQL Server connector (through the enterprise data gateway).
- All write operations are channelled through schema `[ui]` stored procedures to encapsulate logic and auditing.
- Read operations use a blend of stored procedures (for filtered payloads) and direct table/view queries where approved.
- The view `Vw_RVAColumns` is exposed to the app to drive dynamic UI rendering of Report Version Attribute fields.

## Business Processes

### Process: Create or Update a Report
**Trigger:** Analyst chooses to create a new report or edit an existing one.

**Steps:**
1. Load existing metadata via `[ui].[RVAGetDetails]` (if editing) and map to form controls.
2. Capture user edits and submit to `[ui].[ReportsUpsertRVARow]`, which archives prior state and upserts `ReportVersionAttributes`.
3. Log status message into `AppStatusHistory` for audit.
4. Refresh catalog view by re-invoking `[ui].[ReportsGetDetails]`.

**Business Rules:**
- Report owners must exist in `Users`.
- Display granularity (`ViewbyStoreTempcatDept`) is limited to S/T/D options.
- Automatic archive row stored in `Rva_Archive` per update.

### Process: Review Report Analytics
**Trigger:** Analyst opens the analytics tab for a report.

**Steps:**
1. App fetches metrics for selected granularity by calling `[ui].[NEWGetReportData]`.
2. Result set is shaped into Power Apps collections for grid display and KPI cards.
3. Users toggle between S/T/D segments; the app reuses cached data or re-queries if not loaded.

**Business Rules:**
- Granularity must be one of S, T, or D (validated in stored procedure).
- Null projected metrics render as blank for clarity.

### Process: Maintain Bay Rules
**Trigger:** Analyst navigates to bay rule editor for a report.

**Steps:**
1. Retrieve current rules using `[ui].[NEWGetBayRulesByReportID]` and populate editable gallery grouped by `Group_Key`.
2. On submit, serialize updates to JSON and send to `[ui].[NEW_ManageBayRules]`.
3. Procedure truncates existing rules for the report and inserts the new set in a transaction.
4. Success or failure message surfaces to the user with row counts.

**Business Rules:**
- Empty payload keeps the history but results in zero rules, flagged visually as a risk.
- Rule groups limited to defined enumerations (Drivers, Metrics, Resize, Rounding).

### Process: Manage User Access
**Trigger:** Admin adds, edits, or removes a user.

**Steps:**
1. For additions, the app executes `[ui].[UserManAddUser]` and captures `@UserID` for immediate UI refresh.
2. For edits, `[ui].[UserManUpdateUser]` is passed only changed fields, relying on SQL `COALESCE` logic to leave other values unchanged.
3. Deletion attempts trigger `[ui].[UserManDelete]`, which blocks removal if associated reports exist.

**Business Rules:**
- Colour mode restricted to Light (`L`) or Dark (`D`).
- Report ownership check ensures data integrity.
- Licensing metrics pulled from `LicencedUsersCurrent` inform capacity dashboards.

### Process: Monitor Orchestration (Emerging)
**Trigger:** Admin reviews refresh queues.

**Steps:**
1. Dashboard queries `MSO_Orchestrator` for records where `IsFetched`, `IsCalculated`, or `IsDeleted` flags are pending.
2. Status history pulled from `AppStatusHistory` to provide narrative timeline.
3. AppVariables highlight feature toggles impacting orchestration behaviour.

**Business Rules:**
- Only admins can access advanced orchestration data.
- Future enhancements will include manual retry triggers (Power Automate integration).

## Security and Permissions

### Security Model
- Authentication through Azure AD ensures only licensed users access the app.
- Application roles (Analyst, Admin) are mapped to Azure AD groups and mirrored in `Users` table flags (`FunctionalUser`, `AdminUser`).
- Row-level visibility is enforced by filtering datasets on `UserID` where applicable (e.g., report ownership).

### Security Roles
| Role | Description | Permissions |
|------|-------------|-------------|
| Analyst | Access to report catalogue, analytics, bay rule editing | Read/write on report and bay rule stored procedures |
| Admin | Full analyst rights plus user management and configuration screens | Includes execution rights on user procedures and orchestration tables |
| Viewer (planned) | Read-only analytics | Read-only stored procedure wrappers |

### Data Security
- Sensitive write operations encapsulated in `[ui]` schema stored procedures with explicit `TRY/CATCH` blocks.
- `Rva_Archive` maintains change history for recovery and audit.
- No direct table writes from the app; gateway policies enforce stored procedure-only access.

---

## Integration Points

### SQL Stored Procedures and Views
- Power Apps executes approved `[ui]` stored procedures defined in the SQL project to enforce business rules.
- `Vw_RVAColumns` supports dynamic column discovery for the report detail form.

### External Systems
- Azure Blob external data sources (`AzureBlobStorage`, `PerfmaxBlobSource`) are consumed by SQL ETL jobs; results surface in tables the app reads (e.g., performance maxima feeds `MSO_Reports`).
- Legacy macros and staging tables (e.g., `MacroSpaceDates`, `Locations_Staging`) are populated by offline pipelines and serve as read-only references to the app.

### Planned Integrations
- Power Automate flows for refresh orchestration notifications.
- Power BI report embedding for advanced analytics once dataset is published.

## Deployment and Environment Management

### Environments
| Environment | Purpose | Notes |
|-------------|---------|-------|
| Development | Canvas app build and SQL schema changes | Uses dev instance of `MSO-DB-v6` |
| Test | UAT with representative data volume | Requires data refresh from production snapshots |
| Production | Live environment for MSO users | Strict stored procedure access controls |

### Deployment Process
1. Apply SQL schema updates through the `MSO-DB-v6.sqlproj` pipeline (build verified via `dotnet build`).
2. Export managed Power Apps solution tagged with semantic version (matching SQL release tag).
3. Import to Test, validate stored procedure connectivity via gateway.
4. Conduct UAT sign-off covering report creation, analytics retrieval, bay rule update, and user management scenarios.
5. Promote SQL and app packages to Production and run smoke tests.

### Version Control
- SQL project files tracked under `SQL/MSO-DB-v6` with DACPAC outputs for deployment.
- Power App metadata exported routinely to source control (planned integration).
- Change log maintained in this document and Azure DevOps work items.

## Development Guidelines

### Naming Conventions
- **Screens:** `scr_<Feature>` (e.g., `scr_ReportCatalogue`)
- **Collections:** `col<Context>` (e.g., `colReportList`)
- **Variables:** `var<Intent>` (e.g., `varSelectedReportID`)
- **Components:** `cmp_<Purpose>`
- **Stored Procedure Actions:** `sp<ProcedureName>` (Power Apps data source alias)

### Code Standards
- Use `With()` and local collections to minimise repeated SQL calls.
- Surface stored procedure success and error messages in notification banners for transparency.
- Document complex formulas with concise comments, especially when transforming stored procedure outputs.
- Guard all write operations with optimistic concurrency checks where applicable (compare timestamps or hash totals).

### Testing Procedures
- Smoke tests after each deployment: report create/update, analytics read, bay rule submit, user add/edit/delete.
- Regression pack to validate edge cases (e.g., deleting bay rules, report owner transfers).
- Load testing of `[ui].[NEWGetReportData]` when dataset volumes change significantly.
